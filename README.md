A spreadsheet to help calculate and visualise a software low pass filter

Often there is a need to smooth out some data from sensors. For example, when measuring engine RPM using the output from an alternator Y terminal, the instantaneous value of the period can vary quite dramatically depending on engine load and the number of pulses per revolution. Other sensors can give similarly noisy data. To make use of this data a low pass filter is used. 
A simple filter can be built that uses a running average. 
I use this spreadsheet to visualise the effect of different values of Q - the number of samples the running average is calculated over.
